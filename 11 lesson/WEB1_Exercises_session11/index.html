    <h1>Exercise. XML and AJAX</h1>
    <h2>Try out the XML and AJAX. Retrieve and display external content on a web page.</h2>
    <p class="textBox" id="textField1">Text goes here</p>
    <p class="textBox" id="textField2">More text goes here</p>
    <p class="textStyle">NOTE: these exercises will only work if you use the Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>In this session, you have to work in this html document and make the required changes in the JavaScript file
            included with the exercises.</li>
        <li>Create a new XML file that contains data about your SEP1 group members. You should at least have first name,
            last name, birthday, nationality, and email address, but you can include more information if you want to.
        </li>
        <li>Save the XML file in the xml folder that is included with the exercises.</li>
        <li>Add an attribute with the eye color of each group member in your XML file (attributes can't have spaces, so
            the attribute name should be eyeColor).</li>
        <li>Make a jQuery get function that gets your data from the xml folder. The callback function should find the
            first name of the first person in your file and dislpay it in the paragraph with the id
            &quot;textField1&quot;.</li>
        <li>Modify your callback function so that it also displays the eye color of the first person in your file in the
            paragraph with the id &quot;textField2&quot;.</li>
        <li>Create new paragraphs in this HTML file so that you can display the first name and eye color of all your
            SEP1
            group members. Modify the callback function so that it will display all the data for all group members.</li>
        <li>Instead of displaying the data in paragraphs, you should now display the data in a table - you need to
            create the table as shown in the slides (as part of the txt variable on slide 28).</li>
        <li>Make a jQuery get function that gets data from the bookstore.xml file in the "xml" folder. The callback
            function should display the data in a table with the following table headings: Author, Title, Year. You
            should display the data according to the table headings and remember to give your table borders.</li>
        <li>Start working on creating a function to display the data from your SEP1 project on your website.</li>
    </ol>
